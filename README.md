# date_From_Exif_To_Last_Modified
(to change the modified date on a jpg file to the captured on exif data)


Ok, it's been a long time since I did this but this will take all the files (pictures) from a directory, and replace on the exif values
on the "Last Modified" value to the "taken picture date" so even if you take a picture yesterday but you copy it to the computer today, 
it will say that the file was modified yesterday.

So you can have the dates on the files as the taken picture date (someone asked me to do this, I'm not this sick ;) )
